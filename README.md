# CS Summer Journey 🚀

Welcome to my coding journey as a first-year computer science student!  
This repository contains hands-on practice files and mini-projects in:

- 🐍 **Python**: File handling, functions, loops, CSVs, and basic algorithms
- 💻 **Bash scripting**: Shell automation, conditionals, loops, and basic tools

## 📁 Folder Overview

📁 Python_file_handling/ → Working with text and CSV files
📁 python_stuff/ → Core Python concepts and small practice scripts
📁 bash stuff/ → Shell scripting for automation and basic tasks
📁 bash_learning/ → Additional Bash scripting practice and experiments

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong foundation in programming by solving small problems, learning to automate tasks, and organizing code effectively.
